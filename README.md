# MIPS-Assembly-Double-Link-List-FILO-Stack
This MIPS assembly code demonstrates the implementation of a stack data structure, where elements are added to and removed from the right end of the list using pop(), push() adhering to the Last-In, First-Out (LIFO) principle. 
It is written in MARS MIPS Simulator. 
The code provides interactive menu options for user. It utilizes macros to enhance readability, reduce lines of code and errors.
